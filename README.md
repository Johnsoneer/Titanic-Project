# Titanic-Project
A learning project on a Kaggle dataset.

The goal of this particular repo is to display some machine learning methods I've picked up and put them to use in a educational project. The problem I try to solve is 'How can I predict who would survive the sinking of the Titanic?' In 'The Easy Way' folder, I have a step-by step process for how I parsed through the data in order to build a model (RandomForrestClassifier). 

In the other folder, I build a decision tree from scratch in order to show the step-by-step process for how a decision tree automatically splits the features up by importance.
